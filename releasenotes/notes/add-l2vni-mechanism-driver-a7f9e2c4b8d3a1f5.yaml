    Adds a new L2VNI (Layer 2 Virtual Network Identifier) mechanism driver
    that enables baremetal servers to connect to VXLAN and Geneve overlay
    networks. The driver automatically allocates dynamic VLAN segments on
    physical networks and creates OVN localnet ports to bridge overlay traffic
    to baremetal nodes.

    To enable the driver, add ``baremetal_l2vni`` to the mechanism_drivers
    list in ``ml2_conf.ini``:

    .. code-block:: ini

       [ml2]
       mechanism_drivers = ovn,baremetal_l2vni

       [baremetal_l2vni]
       create_localnet_ports = True
       default_physical_network = physnet1

    See the L2VNI mechanism driver documentation for complete configuration
    and deployment details.
