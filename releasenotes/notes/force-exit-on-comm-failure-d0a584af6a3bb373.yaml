    Fixes cases where the ``ironic-neturon-agent`` could enter a state where
    it is no longer operating properly by forcing the agent to exit when
    "hard" communication failures occur which cannot be retried automatically.
    This allows the service runner to understand a failure has occured and
    to restart the agent. The process exit is self-triggered by the agent
    through the use of the SIGABRT signal to indicate non-normal process
    termination.
