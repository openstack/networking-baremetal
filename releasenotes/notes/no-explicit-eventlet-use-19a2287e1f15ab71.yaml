    Explicit usage and monkey-patching with eventlet have been removed. Since
    this is a Neutron plugin, Neutron may still load eventlet modules, but
    networking-baremetal no longer explicitly uses it. Operators should
    be sensitive to potential performance changes, although none are expected.
