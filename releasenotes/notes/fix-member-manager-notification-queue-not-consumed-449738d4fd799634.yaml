    Fixes an issue causing heavy RAM (and/or-storage) usage on the message
    broker back-end. The ``ironic-neutron-agent`` uses oslo.messaging
    notifications, with all notification listeners using pools. Since all
    listeners are using pools the default notification queue in messaging is
    not consumed (only the pool queues are consumed). The default notification
    queue was continuously growing, consuming more and more resources on the
    messaging back-end. See `oslo.messaging bug: 1814544
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo.messaging/+bug/1814544>`_ and `bug:
    2004938 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2004938>`_ for more
    details.
